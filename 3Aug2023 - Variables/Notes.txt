Types of Variables:

There are 2 types of variables.

1. Local Variables :

If a variable is created inside a function, then it is known as local variable. 


The scope of the local variable is with in the function, which means, the local variables can be 
accessed only within the function. 

function f1() {
            var a = 10; // local variable
            var b = 20;
            console.log(a);
            console.log(b);
        }
        f1();
        console.log(a); // error
        console.log(b);

2. Global Variables

A variable that is created outside of the functions is known as global 
variable. 

<html>

<head>

</head>

<body>
    <script>
        var a = 10; // global variable
        var b = 20; // global variable
        function f1() {
            console.log(a);
            console.log(b);
        }
        f1();

        function f2() {
            console.log(a);
            console.log(b);
        }

        f2();
        console.log(a);
        console.log(b);
    </script>
</body>

</html>
Global variables can be accessed any where in the application.
